  description: The counter-flow burner setup consists of fuel (bottom) and oxidizer (top) ducts, kept co-axially opposing each other. The fuel duct (df = 25.4 mm) is surrounded by two concentric annular ducts.  Nitrogen is supplied through the inner annular gap in order to minimize the effect of ambient interference.  The outermost annular duct is connected to an exhaust system, which facilitates the suction of the hot product gases.  The outer walls of this duct are provided with water spray nozzles (type BETE PJ15) to cool the hot product gases  and thereby prevent their autoignition in the exhaust duct. Water is supplied to the spray nozzles through a  mini centrifugal pump (TULLU AC-30). The oxidizer duct (dox = 25.4 mm) is surrounded by a concentric duct  through which nitro- gen is supplied, similar to that used in the fuel duct. Plug-flow boundary condition is  ensured by placing multiple stainless steel wire screens (200 meshes/inch) near the exits of both fuel and  oxidizer ducts. The flow rates of DME, air and ni- trogen are controlled using rotameters (with an uncertainty  2% of full scale reading). The fuel and nitrogen are mixed in a cylindrical mixing chamber of diameter 50 mm  and length 200 mm. A sriees of fine stainless steel meshes are arranged inside the mixing chamber in order to  ensure a homogeneous mixture. The counter-flow burner setup used in the present work is manufactured at UCSD and an exactly similar setup has been previ- ously used by the UCSD group to measure the extinction and auto- ignition characteristics of several fuels.

- title: Jet test facility
  type: inhouse
  incharge: Srinivasn K
  description: The cold free-jet test facility consists of a Khosla-Crepelle compressor,two storage tanks and pipeline system supplying compressed air to all rooms in the laboratory. The air is pressurized using a 150 HP 2-stage, inter-cooled reciprocating air compressor driven by a three phase induction motor. It can pressurize the air up to 8 bars absolute. The compressed air is stored in two separate storage tanks of total capacity of 20 m3. The compressed air is supplied to the experimental area from storage tanks through 4-inch plumbing.

- title: Anechoic chamber
  type: inhouse
  incharge: Srinivasan K
  description: Anechoic chamber serves as a free-field environment for the study of jet noise. It restricts the sound reflections and insulates the acoustic data from external noise. It is of the dimension 2.5 m x 2 m x 2 m. Square pyramidal wedges made of polyurethane foam are adhered to the walls of the chamber except the floor and the floor is lined with carpet. It is calibrated by inverse square law and has cut-off frequency 630 Hz.
