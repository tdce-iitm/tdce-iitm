bio: Prof. V. Raghavan received his PhD from IIT Madras in 2004. He worked as Post Doctoral Research Fellow and Research Assistant Professor at University of Nebraska-Lincoln for around three years from Oct 2004 to June 2007 before joining IIT Madras. His research interest includes droplet evaporation and combustion, laminar flames and CFD applied to combustion. He works on transient two-phase numerical modeling of isolated droplet vaporization and combustion, detailed chemical kinetics studies on homogeneous and heterogeneous flames and simulations of non-reactive and reactive particle laden flows.
