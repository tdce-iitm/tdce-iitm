bio: S M Ali has completed his B.Tech in Production Engineering from NIT Calicut in 2014. He has joined the integrated M.S-PhD programme in Aerospace Engineering in 2014 at IIT Madras. Currently, he is working on the development of a new strategy for optimization of simplified kinetic mechanisms for non-premixed flames. The ultimate goal of work is to develop a simplified kinetic mechanism for prediction of emissions from practical combustors working on biomass gasification derived fuels.
