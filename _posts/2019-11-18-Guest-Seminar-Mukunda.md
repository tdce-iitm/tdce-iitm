In the first part of this session, Prof. Mukunda will give a brief overview of his research in the field of combustion, gasification and propulsion. This will be followed by an interactive hour where research students and faculty members can raise points for discussion on topics, either of direct interest to their research or of general nature in the field of combustion. Let the discussion flow!

Speaker Bio <br><br>
With over 50 years of experience in combustion research at IISc Bangalore, Prof. Mukunda continues to contribute to combustion science through fundamental studies and his active involvement in development of combustion and propulsion systems for space and defence applications. His choice of research problems is motivated by their relevance to the Indian industries.
Resolution of conflicting ideas on theories of regression rates in boundary layer flames pertinent to hybrid rockets, discovery of universality of erosive burning, and the development of the heterogeneous quasi 1-D model for solid rocket propellants are a few examples which illustrate his approach to research. He is also well known for his achievements in developing biomass gasification systems for rural electrification and domestic cooking. Development of clean and efficient biomass based cooking devices is something that he continues to pursue with passion at the Fire and Combustion Research Center at Jain University, Bangalore.
