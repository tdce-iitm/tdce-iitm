title: A kinetic modeling based study on the importance of unsaturated ester content in biodiesel surrogates
description: Biodiesel, a mixture of different methyl esters is one of the potential fuels to replace conventional fossil fuels. There is a need to understand the kinetics of methyl esters. In our recent studies the kinetics of methyl butanoate, a saturated methyl ester has been investigated as it can represent the methyl ester functional group of biodiesel. The composition of biodiesel reveals a significant amount of unsaturated esters and hence unsaturated ester kinetics has to be investigated. In this study, the kinetics of methyl crotonate will be studied leading to the development of a combined biodiesel surrogate formulation comprising of dodecane, methyl butanoate and methyl crotonoate. The importance of unsaturation will be studied and rate rules for larger esters will be formulated.
