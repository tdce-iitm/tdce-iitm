title: Hydrogen generation by water splitting in thermochemical reactor using Solar Energy 
description: Water splitting is the chemical reaction in which water is broken down to oxygen and hydrogen. In this fuel-hungry world, hydrogen can prove as an alternative, clean source of energy. The generation of hydrogen has been in research since 1960s, but the efficiency and feasibility have to be improved to reach a practically viable state. Production of Hydrogen using Solar concentrated power was found to be the most efficient.
