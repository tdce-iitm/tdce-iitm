title: Liquid breakup unsteadiness in coaxial air blast atomizers.
description: Liquid jet atomization is a highly unsteady process which leads to a periodical temporal change in the spray characteristics downstream such as liquid volume flux, droplet size and number density. Under different flow conditions, different jet instabilities such as helical, Kelvin-Helmholtz, flapping instability are observed. Hence, experimental investigation of these instabilities are done using Optical Connectivity (OC) technique and high-speed shadowgraphy technique. OC technique is used for visualization of liquid jet core and measurement of mean breakup length and fluctuations in breakup length is done. Liquid jet interface tracking on the high-speed images is done in order to identify the amplitude and frequency corresponding to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and flapping instability. In order to further capture the unsteady dynamics of the jet breakup process, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is done.
