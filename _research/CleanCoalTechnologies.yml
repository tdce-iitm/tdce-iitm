title: Experimental and computational studies on MILD coal combustor/ gasifier
description: Despite the push for renewable energy sources, coal combustion is to play a major role in the energy sector of the world and India in particular. Any increase in the efficiency of the existing coal combustion technologies would lead to a significant reduction in fuel consumption and carbon-dioxide emissions. Motivated by the MILD combustion technique using jets with large velocity differential, efforts are on to combust/gasify high ash Indian coal in an efficient manner. Computational studies which are backed by a single particle coal combustion model, shed light on the combustor dynamics. Insights from the preliminary experiments and computations are used to tailor the composition of the syngas obtained from gasification of coal using mixtures of O2/CO2/H2O.
