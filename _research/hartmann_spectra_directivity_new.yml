title: Spectra and directivity of a Hartmann whistle
description: Cavities placed in high speed flows can serve as high intensity, narrow band acoustic sources with selective directivity. Such sources can be gainfully used to control the flow, mixing and combustion processes in various propulsion applications.The flow diversion around the cavity explains the observed shift in directivity towards higher angles for the whistle, as compared to the free jet flow. The acoustic power and efficiency are high for small values of stand-off distances and larger cavity lengths.
