title: Investigation of structure and spread rate of flames over PMMA slabs
description: Experimental and numerical investigations of upward and downward flame spread over flat polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) slabs are presented here. Experiments have been carried out using PMMA slabs of different thickness in the range of 1.6 mm–5.4 mm. Downward and upward flame spread processes have been recorded under atmospheric pressure and normal gravity conditions. Careful repeatable high resolution measurements of temperature and species fields have also been carried out, to fill the scarcity of such data in literature. A simple numerical model, used widely to simulate flame spread over condensed surfaces, called Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), has been employed to numerically simulate the experimental cases. Results from FDS have been validated against numerical and experimental data from literature, by comparing quantities such as mass loss rate, flame spread velocity and flame structure. FDS is seen to capture essential transport processes of a spreading diffusion flame. The overall comparison of the trends has been quite reasonable. Numerical model is capable of predicting the unsteady and steady features of downward spread as well as transient rapid upward flame spread, as observed in the experimental results.
