title: A study on the effect of initial conditions on noise from underexpanded pipe jets
description: An experimental investigation of acoustic radiation from underexpanded air jets of different shear layer thicknesses has been performed. The initial shear layer thickness variation is achieved by allowing the jet to exit through pipes of various lengths. Acoustic radiation is characterized in terms of overall sound pressure level, directivity, tonal, and broadband shock associated noise. Increase in initial shear layer thickness in pipe jets results in the decrease of screech tone amplitude and increase in broadband shock associated noise level. Turbulent mixing noise levels are higher for shorter pipe jets compared to longer ones. Longer pipe jets exhibit more number of screech modes while the shorter pipe jets show only one or two screech modes. The screech frequency and the peak frequency of broadband shock associated noise do not show much variation with increase in initial shear layer thickness.
