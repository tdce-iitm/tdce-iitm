title: Data driven prediction of ignition delays
description: Ignition delay has an important role in combustion. Ignition delay is  affected by different parameters such as temperature, pressure, Equivalence ratio, etc. The objective of the topic is to predict ignition delays of fuels based on the molecular structure and the aforementioned parameters.
