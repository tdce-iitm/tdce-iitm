title: Steam Reforming of Ethanol in Meso and Micro-channel systems for Hydrogen production
description: With the need for sustainable energy, demand for clean and renewable energy is increasing. Hydrogen fuel cells is hence, gaining popularity for its application in the Automotive sector. However, there are safety concerns with regard to handling and storing of hydrogen. Therefore, the idea is to produce hydrogen on the spot and feed it directly to the Fuel cells. This can be done through a process called steam reforming, where hydrocarbons can be broken down in the presence of heat. Study of such a process is done using meso and micro-channel systems in view of space and process optimization.
