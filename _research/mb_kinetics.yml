title: Experimental and chemical kinetic modeling investigation of methyl butanoate as a component of biodiesel surrogate
description: Biodiesel  is  a  potential  alternative  to  fossil  diesel.  In  combustion  simulations,  in  order  to  circumvent the  difficulty  in  integrating  reaction  schemes  for  biodiesels,  which  are  typically  of  a  large  size  and not  well  understood,  a  surrogate  approach  to  simplify  the  representation  of  its  long  chain  methylester  components  is  adopted.  In  this  work,  a  compact  reaction  scheme  for  methyl  butanoate, which  is  a  potentially  important  candidate  for  biodiesel  surrogates,  is derived, updated with recent literature, and comprehesively validated. The  effect  of  addition  of  low-temperature chemistry  pathways  to  the  methyl  butanoate  chemical  kinetic  mechanism  has  also  been  explored.
