title: Studies on swirl jets
description: Influence of swirl number on jet noise reduction has been studied. In this work, jet noise reduction using a swirling flow surrounding a circular free jet has been demonstrated and the flow visualization also done to confirm the noise reduction. The co-axial swirl jets always reduce the low frequency noise, irrespective of the nozzle pressure ratio. The screech tone is entirely eliminated and broadband shock associated noise mitigated by the co-axial swirl jets This work proposes swirl as an excellent passive tool for jet noise suppression.
