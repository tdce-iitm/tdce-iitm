title: Spray dynamics simulations (RANS) for pulsatile injection at different ambient pressure and temperature conditions
description : The emphasis is on understanding the effect of higher ambient pressure and temperature as well as the initial fuel temperature on the spray dispersion and evaporation processes. The spray characteristics like penetration length, SMD, droplet and gas-phase velocities, and the mixture distribution are investigated.
type: sprays
