title: An Experimental and Numerical Investigation of Non-Reacting and Reacting Vortex Rings.
description: A jet of fluid intermittently ejects from a nozzle causes the roll-up of boundary layers, there by it leads to the formation of vortex rings. A vortex ring consists of rotating core fluid at its top portion, followed by a tail at its bottom. During the upward motion of the vortex ring, the rotating vortex core drags the ambient fluid along with it through viscous action. This will improve the mixing between vortex fluid and the surrounding ambient fluid. In the current research work, mixing between the fuel and the oxidizer are studied for different vortex generating conditions. The fuel-air mixture inside the vortex rings is ignited and the resulting reacting (combusting) vortex rings are also studied for the different fuel-air mixture compositions of vortex fluid.
