title: Jet noise control using passive grids
description: Reducing supersonic jet noise by active and passive control techniques has been of great interest to researchers and scientists. Its application in commercial and military aviation is vital for both safety and human comfort. In the present study, the passive method is used to control the under-expanded free jet noise by using passive grids. The main advantage of passive control method over the active control method is that the method does not require any external power source for noise control. The presence of grids successfully eliminate the dominant tones (screech) by disrupting the feedback loop and attenuate the Broadband Shock Associated Noise by converting strong shock cells into weaker multiple shock-lets.
