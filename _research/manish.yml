title: Droplet clustering and local spray unsteadiness in air-assisted sprays
description: The paper has two goals. First, to experimentally characterize the droplet clusters in air-assist sprays, and second, to study the consequence of droplet clustering on the local spray unsteadiness by measurement of turbulent number flux of droplets. Unlike clustering of droplets in spray-laden turbulent flows, the entrained air flow around a spray plays a very important role in the dispersion of droplets in the spray. The present work also examines the influence of local liquid mass fraction on clustering of droplet in the spray, which has not been considered in detail in the earlier works.
