title: Packed bed gasification of biomass with O2/CO2/Steam
description: Syngas generation using air as a gasifying medium with biomass/coal as fuel is a well established technique used currently in small and medium power and heating applications. It is also possible to tailor the syngas compostion in a single step process by replacing the inert nitrogen component in air with reactive components like CO2 and steam. The resulting syngas, rich in CO and hydrogen can be used in catalytic polymerization reactors (say FT for instance) to produce liquid fuels and fine chemicals. Objective of the work is explore the fundamental characteristics gasification/combustion of biomass in a canonical counter current reactor with mixtures of O2/CO2/steam as oxidizers. Syngas quality improvement, understanding the dynamics of packed beds and framing a theoretical model to predict the propagation rate and gas compostion are the main outcomes of the work.
