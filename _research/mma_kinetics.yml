title: Compact kinetic model for methylmethacrylate oxidation
description: Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) is widely used in transport and construction sectors. In order to analyze the high temperature gas phase oxidation of PMMA, and thereby predict its fire behaviour with less computational effort, a compact kinetic model for the oxidation of its primary decomposition product, methyl methacrylate (its monomer) CH2=C(CH3)-C(=O)-O-CH3 (MMA), is most essential.  As a part of this work, a compact reaction model to describe the oxidation of MMA is developed and validated against fundamental experimental datasets obtained in premixed flames. The final `short MMA mechanism' consists of 88 species and 1092 reactions.
