title: Afterburner screech
description: Screech is a high frequency tonal noise generated from afterburners (AB, for short and used for thrust augmentation in gas turbine engines) as  a result of coupling of combustion heat release fluctuations with the acoustic modes of the afterburner. Liner, which is a perforated annular chamber enclosing the flame holder and extending through the length of the AB acts as passive damping device to suppress amplification of acoustic oscillations. The damping characteristics of the liner are dependent on the size, number and more importantly the Mach numbers of the bias and grazing flow. We are developing a CFD based tool for design of acoustic liners for ABs.
