title: Premixed combustion instabilities in confined channels 
description : Premixed flames in confined channels give rise to some of the interesting physical phenomena. The evolution path of the flame kernel and flow field after ignition are very important in determining final flame and flow features. The problem of stability of the premixed flames in meso-channels is studied widely in the literature due to its widespread applications. The study concerns about this aspect of flame holding in meso-channels and associated flame and flow instabilities.
