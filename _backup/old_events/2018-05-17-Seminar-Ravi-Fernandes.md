This presentation will discuss the ongoing and future research activities at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS) on fluid energy carriers for advanced combustion. 
A special emphasis will be on current projects related to LNG, Hydrogen, Ammonia and Tailor Made Biofuels (TMFB), where an extensive set of “state-of the-art” measurement techniques are employed coupling shock tubes, RCM with advanced diagnostics, to probe some of the elusive chemical species. The results facilitate a deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms and validation of chemical kinetic models. The validated models in-turn support a design process for co-optimizing fuels and engines for efficient and clean combustion.
