            <p class="lead">Addition of oxygenates to diesel fuel has been found to reduce soot emissions and increase its resistance to extinction, which means that a combustion system can be made more stable even at higher strain rates and at the same time operate with reduced emissions.  In order to critically evaluate the overall combustion behaviour of DME via numerical simulations, an accurate as well as compact kinetic mechanism consisting of 23 species and 88 elementary reactions is proposed to describe the oxidation of DME in premixed as well as non-premixed systems. This mechanism is further reduced by introducing quasi-steady state assumptions for six intermediate species to finally obtain a 14-step global kinetic scheme. A code is developed in MATLAB to obtain these 14 global steps and their corresponding rate expressions in terms of the elementary reaction rates.</p>

In  combustion  simulations,  in  order  to  circumvent the  difficulty  in  integrating  reaction  schemes  for  biodiesels,  which  are  typically  of  a  large  size  and not  well  understood,  a  surrogate  approach  to  simplify  the  representation  of  its  long  chain  methylester  components  is  adopted.  In  this  work,  a  compact  reaction  scheme  for  methyl  butanoate, which  is  a  potentially  important  candidate  for  biodiesel  surrogates,  is derived, updated with recent literature, and comprehesively validated.

<p class="lead">Biodiesel, a mixture of different methyl esters is one of the potential fuels to replace conventional fossil fuels. There is a need to understand the kinetics of methyl esters. In our recent studies the kinetics of methyl butanoate, a saturated methyl ester has been investigated as it can represent the methyl ester functional group of biodiesel. The composition of biodiesel reveals a significant amount of unsaturated esters and hence unsaturated ester kinetics has to be investigated. In this study, the kinetics of methyl crotonate will be studied leading to the development of a combined biodiesel surrogate formulation comprising of dodecane, methyl butanoate and methyl crotonoate. The importance of unsaturation will be studied and rate rules for larger esters will be formulated.</p>

            <p class="lead">Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) is widely used in transport and construction sectors. In order to analyze the high temperature gas phase oxidation of PMMA, and thereby predict its fire behaviour with less computational effort, a compact kinetic model for the oxidation of its primary decomposition product, methyl methacrylate (its monomer) CH2=C(CH3)-C(=O)-O-CH3 (MMA), is most essential.  As a part of this work, a compact reaction model to describe the oxidation of MMA is developed and validated against fundamental experimental datasets obtained in premixed flames. The final `short MMA mechanism' consists of 88 species and 1092 reactions.</p>

<p class="lead">Despite the push for renewable energy sources, coal combustion is to play a major role in the energy sector of the world and India in particular. Any increase in the efficiency of the existing coal combustion technologies would lead to a significant reduction in fuel consumption and carbon-dioxide emissions. Motivated by the MILD combustion technique using jets with large velocity differential, efforts are on to combust/gasify high ash Indian coal in an efficient manner. Computational studies which are backed by a single particle coal combustion model, shed light on the combustor dynamics. Insights from the preliminary experiments and computations are used to tailor the composition of the syngas obtained from gasification of coal using mixtures of O2/CO2/H2O.</p>

            <p class="lead">In this study, co-gasification of rice husk and coal in a lab-scale bubbling bed gasification reactor is reported. Blends of Indian coal with 36% ash and Indian rice husk with 22% ash are used considering proper particle sizes, air flow rates and steam flow rates. Air and steam are used as gasification agents. The reactor is operated at 40 kW (thermal), under atmospheric pressure. Blends are prepared on the basis of power share; rice husk percentage in the blend is varied to contribute to 0–90% of the total power. Results shows that when rice husk is added, all the performance metrics such as total carbon conversion, cold gas efficiency and calorific value of the synthetic gas, show increasing trend. When rice husk contributes from 50% to 75% of the total power, the total carbon conversion is around 89%, cold gas efficiency is around 78% and the calorific value of the synthetic gas is around 5.4 MJ/cubic-meter. Methane yield increases from a volumetric percentage of 1% with 0% rice husk to around 8.37% with 75% rice husk. In summary, a good performance is achieved and blending of rice husk and high ash coal is highly beneficial.</p>

<p class="lead">Syngas generation using air as a gasifying medium with biomass/coal as fuel is a well established technique used currently in small and medium power and heating applications. It is also possible to tailor the syngas compostion in a single step process by replacing the inert nitrogen component in air with reactive components like CO2 and steam. The resulting syngas, rich in CO and hydrogen can be used in catalytic polymerization reactors (say FT for instance) to produce liquid fuels and fine chemicals. Objective of the work is explore the fundamental characteristics gasification/combustion of biomass in a canonical counter current reactor with mixtures of O2/CO2/steam as oxidizers. Syngas quality improvement, understanding the dynamics of packed beds and framing a theoretical model to predict the propagation rate and gas compostion are the main outcomes of the work.</p>

<p class="lead">Screech is a high frequency tonal noise generated from afterburners (AB, for short and used for thrust augmentation in gas turbine engines) as  a result of coupling of combustion heat release fluctuations with the acoustic modes of the afterburner. Liner, which is a perforated annular chamber enclosing the flame holder and extending through the length of the AB acts as passive damping device to suppress amplification of acoustic oscillations. The damping characteristics of the liner are dependent on the size, number and more importantly the Mach numbers of the bias and grazing flow. We are developing a CFD based tool for design of acoustic liners for ABs.</p>

<p class="lead">A new and novel approach to modeling composite propellant burn rate behavior is proposed based on the fact that composite propellant combustion is largely boxed between the premixed limits – of pure AP and fine AP-binder (HTPB, here) whose burn behaviors are taken as known. The current strategy accounts for particle size distribution using the burn time averaging approach. The specialty of the present approach is that it invokes local extinction for fuel rich conditions for specific particle sizes when the heat balance causes the surface temperature to drop below the low pressure deflagration limit of AP; this feature allows for the prediction of extinction of propellant combustion. Comparisons of burn rate data over nearly thirty compositions from different sources appear excellent to good.</p>

            <p class="lead">Spray breakup processes of small-scale simplex atomizers have been characterized. With tangential entry of fuel, the cases of no air flow and concentric co-swirl air flow are considered. Ten simplex atomizers with different values of dimensionless tangential port area K have been employed. The breakup mode changes from film breakup to jet breakup, with increase in K value. For small K values, small port area causes high liquid swirl, which aids in the formation of an air core and a hollow cone spray with large cone angle. At high K values, jet breakup gives rise to a full cone spray with a small cone angle. The SauterMean Diameter (SMD) for the spray exhibits bimodal variation in the radial direction close to the atomizer. Based on a large volume of data for kerosene and water sprays, accurate correlations (covering wide operating conditions) have been developed for the spray cone angle, Cd, and axial variation of SMD for small-scale simplex atomizers. Swirl air interaction with the liquid film causes a transition from closed tulip shape to an open spray at a critical air flow rate. The critical air flow rate for transition is initial condition-dependent and it  exhibits hysteresis.</p>

            <p class="lead">Experimental and numerical investigations of upward and downward flame spread over flat polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) slabs are presented here. Experiments have been carried out using PMMA slabs of different thickness in the range of 1.6 mm–5.4 mm. Downward and upward flame spread processes have been recorded under atmospheric pressure and normal gravity conditions. Careful repeatable high resolution measurements of temperature and species fields have also been carried out, to fill the scarcity of such data in literature. These data illustrate the structure and spread rates of flames established over PMMA slabs. A simple numerical model, used widely to simulate flame spread over condensed surfaces, called Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), has been employed to numerically simulate the experimental cases. Infinite rate chemistry and sublimation based interface model have been used. FDS is economical when compared to CFD tools such as FLUENT and OpenFOAM. It provides predictive results when compared to theoretical models. Results from FDS have been validated against numerical and experimental data from literature, by comparing quantities such as mass loss rate, flame spread velocity and flame structure. FDS is seen to capture essential transport processes of a spreading diffusion flame. Even though discrepancies have been observed between the numerical and experimental results near the fuel surface, the overall comparison of the trends has been quite reasonable. Numerical model is capable of predicting the unsteady and steady features of downward spread as well as transient rapid upward flame spread, as observed in the experimental results. Detailed structure and flow field have been presented and discussed.</p>
