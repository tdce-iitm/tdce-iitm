<p class="lead">Addition of oxygenates to diesel fuel has been found to reduce soot emissions and increase its resistance to extinction, which means that a combustion system can be made more stable even at higher strain rates and at the same time operate with reduced emissions.  In order to critically evaluate the overall combustion behaviour of DME via numerical simulations, an accurate as well as compact kinetic mechanism consisting of 23 species and 88 elementary reactions is proposed to describe the oxidation of DME in premixed as well as non-premixed systems. This mechanism is further reduced by introducing quasi-steady state assumptions for six intermediate species to finally obtain a 14-step global kinetic scheme. A code is developed in MATLAB to obtain these 14 global steps and their corresponding rate expressions in terms of the elementary reaction rates.</p>

In  combustion  simulations,  in  order  to  circumvent the  difficulty  in  integrating  reaction  schemes  for  biodiesels,  which  are  typically  of  a  large  size  and not  well  understood,  a  surrogate  approach  to  simplify  the  representation  of  its  long  chain  methylester  components  is  adopted.  In  this  work,  a  compact  reaction  scheme  for  methyl  butanoate, which  is  a  potentially  important  candidate  for  biodiesel  surrogates,  is derived, updated with recent literature, and comprehesively validated.

            <p class="lead">Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) is widely used in transport and construction sectors. In order to analyze the high temperature gas phase oxidation of PMMA, and thereby predict its fire behaviour with less computational effort, a compact kinetic model for the oxidation of its primary decomposition product, methyl methacrylate (its monomer) CH2=C(CH3)-C(=O)-O-CH3 (MMA), is most essential.  As a part of this work, a compact reaction model to describe the oxidation of MMA is developed and validated against fundamental experimental datasets obtained in premixed flames. The final `short MMA mechanism' consists of 88 species and 1092 reactions.</p>

<p class="lead">Despite the push for renewable energy sources, coal combustion is to play a major role in the energy sector of the world and India in particular. Any increase in the efficiency of the existing coal combustion technologies would lead to a significant reduction in fuel consumption and carbon-dioxide emissions. Motivated by the MILD combustion technique using jets with large velocity differential, efforts are on to combust/gasify high ash Indian coal in an efficient manner. Computational studies which are backed by a single particle coal combustion model, shed light on the combustor dynamics. Insights from the preliminary experiments and computations are used to tailor the composition of the syngas obtained from gasification of coal using mixtures of O2/CO2/H2O.</p>

            <p class="lead">In this study, co-gasification of rice husk and coal in a lab-scale bubbling bed gasification reactor is reported. Blends of Indian coal with 36% ash and Indian rice husk with 22% ash are used considering proper particle sizes, air flow rates and steam flow rates. Air and steam are used as gasification agents. The reactor is operated at 40 kW (thermal), under atmospheric pressure. Blends are prepared on the basis of power share; rice husk percentage in the blend is varied to contribute to 0–90% of the total power. Results shows that when rice husk is added, all the performance metrics such as total carbon conversion, cold gas efficiency and calorific value of the synthetic gas, show increasing trend. When rice husk contributes from 50% to 75% of the total power, the total carbon conversion is around 89%, cold gas efficiency is around 78% and the calorific value of the synthetic gas is around 5.4 MJ/cubic-meter. Methane yield increases from a volumetric percentage of 1% with 0% rice husk to around 8.37% with 75% rice husk. In summary, a good performance is achieved and blending of rice husk and high ash coal is highly beneficial.</p>

<p class="lead">Syngas generation using air as a gasifying medium with biomass/coal as fuel is a well established technique used currently in small and medium power and heating applications. It is also possible to tailor the syngas compostion in a single step process by replacing the inert nitrogen component in air with reactive components like CO2 and steam. The resulting syngas, rich in CO and hydrogen can be used in catalytic polymerization reactors (say FT for instance) to produce liquid fuels and fine chemicals. Objective of the work is explore the fundamental characteristics gasification/combustion of biomass in a canonical counter current reactor with mixtures of O2/CO2/steam as oxidizers. Syngas quality improvement, understanding the dynamics of packed beds and framing a theoretical model to predict the propagation rate and gas compostion are the main outcomes of the work.</p>

<p class="lead">Screech is a high frequency tonal noise generated from afterburners (AB, for short and used for thrust augmentation in gas turbine engines) as  a result of coupling of combustion heat release fluctuations with the acoustic modes of the afterburner. Liner, which is a perforated annular chamber enclosing the flame holder and extending through the length of the AB acts as passive damping device to suppress amplification of acoustic oscillations. The damping characteristics of the liner are dependent on the size, number and more importantly the Mach numbers of the bias and grazing flow. We are developing a CFD based tool for design of acoustic liners for ABs.</p>

<p class="lead">A new and novel approach to modeling composite propellant burn rate behavior is proposed based on the fact that composite propellant combustion is largely boxed between the premixed limits – of pure AP and fine AP-binder (HTPB, here) whose burn behaviors are taken as known. The current strategy accounts for particle size distribution using the burn time averaging approach. The specialty of the present approach is that it invokes local extinction for fuel rich conditions for specific particle sizes when the heat balance causes the surface temperature to drop below the low pressure deflagration limit of AP; this feature allows for the prediction of extinction of propellant combustion. Comparisons of burn rate data over nearly thirty compositions from different sources appear excellent to good.</p>

<p class="lead">Reducing supersonic jet noise by active and passive control techniques has been of great interest to researchers and scientists. Its application in commercial and military aviation is vital for both safety and human comfort. In the present study, the passive method is used to control the under-expanded free jet noise by using passive grids. The main advantage of passive control method over the active control method is that the method does not require any external power source for noise control. The presence of grids successfully eliminate the dominant tones (screech) by disrupting the feedback loop and attenuate the Broadband Shock Associated Noise by converting strong shock cells into weaker multiple shock-lets.</p>

<p class="lead">The current work investigates the effect of Hartmann cavity acoustics on the atomization of droplet sprays. Initially, the experiments are conducted on a single droplet to understand its behavior in the sound field of a Hartmann whistle. The atomization studies on single droplet reveal that the existence of sound field causes the droplet to undergo large deformation and become irregular in shape. The degree of droplet deformation is quantified based on smaller circularity and larger Feret's diameter. The increase in cone angle of spray to a higher value in the presence of acoustics in comparison to its absence shows that the acoustics enhances the atomization. The stroboscopic visualization of sprays in the presence of acoustics further reveals the breakup of ligaments, large scatter as well as the formation of more number of droplets, indicating atomization enhancement.</p>

Such sources can be gainfully used to control the flow, mixing and combustion processes in various propulsion applications.The flow diversion around the cavity explains the observed shift in directivity towards higher angles for the whistle, as compared to the free jet flow. The acoustic power and efficiency are high for small values of stand-off distances and larger cavity lengths.</p>

<p class="lead">An experimental investigation of acoustic radiation from underexpanded air jets of different shear layer thicknesses has been performed. The initial shear layer thickness variation is achieved by allowing the jet to exit through pipes of various lengths. Acoustic radiation is characterized in terms of overall sound pressure level, directivity, tonal, and broadband shock associated noise. Increase in initial shear layer thickness in pipe jets results in the decrease of screech tone amplitude and increase in broadband shock associated noise level. Turbulent mixing noise levels are higher for shorter pipe jets compared to longer ones. Longer pipe jets exhibit more number of screech modes while the shorter pipe jets show only one or two screech modes. The screech frequency and the peak frequency of broadband shock associated noise do not show much variation with increase in initial shear layer thickness.</p>

            <p class="lead">Spray breakup processes of small-scale simplex atomizers have been characterized. With tangential entry of fuel, the cases of no air flow and concentric co-swirl air flow are considered. Ten simplex atomizers with different values of dimensionless tangential port area K have been employed. The breakup mode changes from film breakup to jet breakup, with increase in K value. For small K values, small port area causes high liquid swirl, which aids in the formation of an air core and a hollow cone spray with large cone angle. At high K values, jet breakup gives rise to a full cone spray with a small cone angle. The SauterMean Diameter (SMD) for the spray exhibits bimodal variation in the radial direction close to the atomizer. Based on a large volume of data for kerosene and water sprays, accurate correlations (covering wide operating conditions) have been developed for the spray cone angle, Cd, and axial variation of SMD for small-scale simplex atomizers. Swirl air interaction with the liquid film causes a transition from closed tulip shape to an open spray at a critical air flow rate. The critical air flow rate for transition is initial condition-dependent and it  exhibits hysteresis.</p>

The model has been validated using the experimental data available in literature for suspended heptane-decane blended droplets evaporating under a forced convective air environment. The validated model is used to study the vaporization characteristics of heptane-decane droplets under different convective conditions. For an initial composition having 75% by volume of more volatile fuel component, the evaporation transients are presented in terms of variations in interface quantities. Flow, species and temperature fields are presented at several time instants to show the relative strengths of forced convection and Marangoni convection. Results show that at low initial Reynolds numbers, the solutal Marangoni effects induce a flow-field within the liquid droplet, which opposes the flow of the external convective field. The strength of this liquid-phase flow field increases with the consumption of the more volatile fuel component.</p>

<p class="lead">This paper presents comprehensive numerical simulations of evaporation of droplets constituted of two liquid fuels in high pressure nitrogen ambient under normal gravity condition. A transient, two-phase and axisymmetric numerical model has been used for the simulations. Transport processes in liquid- and vapor-phases have been solved along with interface coupling conditions. Gas-phase non-idealities, solubility of ambient gas in liquid-phase, and pressure and temperature based variable thermo-physical properties in both liquid- and vapor-phases are considered in the numerical model. Phase equilibrium has been estimated using fugacity coefficients of all species in both phases. The range of Weber number has been chosen such that droplet remains almost spherical throughout its lifetime. Simulations have been carried out until the droplet surface regresses to one-tenth of its initial value or when the critical state for the mixture is reached. The numerical model has been quantitatively validated against the experimental data available in literature. The validated model is used to systematically study the evaporation characteristics of suspended n-heptane-hexadecane droplets in nitrogen ambient. The effects of the pressure, temperature, initial liquid-phase composition and forced convection velocity on evaporation characteristics have been discussed in detail.</p>

First, to experimentally characterize the droplet clusters in air-assist sprays, and second, to study the consequence of droplet clustering on the local spray unsteadiness by measurement of turbulent number flux of droplets. Unlike clustering of droplets in spray-laden turbulent flows, the entrained air flow around a spray plays a very important role in the dispersion of droplets in the spray. The present work also examines the influence of local liquid mass fraction on clustering of droplet in the spray, which has not been considered in detail in the earlier works.</p>

<p class="lead">Biogas is an alternative fuel that typically contains around 45% carbon-dioxide by volume, besides methane. Due to the inherent content of carbon-dioxide, it is necessary to study the flame characteristics and stability limits in cross-flow non-premixed burners. In this study, cross-flow non-premixed flames, where biogas is injected through a horizontal porous plate and air is blown parallel to the fuel injector, are studied systematically. In order to increase the stable operating regime, devices such as backward facing steps and cylindrical bluff-bodies are commonly employed. Different step-heights and locations from leading edge of the fuel injector are considered for the cases with backward facing steps. A rectangular cylindrical bluff-body is also used as a flame stabilizing obstacle. Baseline cases are studied without any backward facing step or cylindrical bluff-body. Volume flow rate of biogas is varied from 36 liter per hour to 360 liter  per  hour. Air velocity is varied in the range of 0.2 m/s to 3.0 m/s. For a given fuel velocity, air velocity is gradually increased in order to record the transition of flame from one regime to another. Flame stabilization is carefully assessed by monitoring the high definition direct flame photographs captured from front and top views, for all the cases. The cases are repeated at least three times to ensure repeatability. Stability maps are plotted as a function of fuel velocity and air velocity for all the cases. For cases with backward facing steps, both step height and its location play an important role in delineating the boundaries of the flame regimes. Parametric variations show interesting features. Bluff-body flames become quite oscillatory and three dimensional at higher air velocities. For this case, stability maps of flames from biogas and pure methane are compared.</p>

<p class="lead">Experimental investigation of the effect of flow turbulence on the steady state burning of methanol is reported. A vertical air tunnel has been mounted with a grid at its exit plane in order to generate turbulence in the free jet stream. The flow field has been characterized using a hot-wire anemometer. Mean and fluctuating flow velocities and integral scale have been measured at an axial location of around 2 times its exit diameter (D). Three types of grids have been used. Classical porous sphere experiments have been carried out to analyze the steady-state burning rate of methanol over the surface of an inert sphere having constant diameter. Experiments have been done at atmospheric pressure under ambient temperature and normal gravity conditions. A porous sphere is positioned at an axial location of 2D, where the approaching flow has been characterized in detail. Results show that the burning rate as well as the flame stability are greatly influenced by the free stream turbulence. The ratio of turbulent time scales and the chemical time scales for grid mounted cases have been estimated from the integral scale, root mean square velocity fluctuation, flame stand-off distance and the vapor blowing velocity. Empirical expression relating the normalized burning rates to diffusion scale based Damköhlar number has been presented. A correlation for Sherwood number as a function of Reynolds number and turbulent intensity has also been proposed.</p>

            <p class="lead">Experimental and numerical investigations of upward and downward flame spread over flat polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) slabs are presented here. Experiments have been carried out using PMMA slabs of different thickness in the range of 1.6 mm–5.4 mm. Downward and upward flame spread processes have been recorded under atmospheric pressure and normal gravity conditions. Careful repeatable high resolution measurements of temperature and species fields have also been carried out, to fill the scarcity of such data in literature. A simple numerical model, used widely to simulate flame spread over condensed surfaces, called Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), has been employed to numerically simulate the experimental cases. Results from FDS have been validated against numerical and experimental data from literature, by comparing quantities such as mass loss rate, flame spread velocity and flame structure. FDS is seen to capture essential transport processes of a spreading diffusion flame. The overall comparison of the trends has been quite reasonable. Numerical model is capable of predicting the unsteady and steady features of downward spread as well as transient rapid upward flame spread, as observed in the experimental results.</p>
